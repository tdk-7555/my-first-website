    <h1>About Tirmizi Trips</h1>
    <h2>About Me - The Founder:</h2>

    <p>My name is Mohammad Osman. I'm a British Pakistani/Mauritian, born and raised in the UK. Growing up, I would be travelling to both my Home countries often. However, I had never really been on a proper holiday to any other countries.</p>
    <p>As I got older, I started to travel to other places too and discovered my love for travel. I realised I loved sight-seeing and learning about other cultures. So far, I would say my favourite destinations have been: California, Bursa and New York.</p>

    <h2>Why Tirmizi Trips was created</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, often when going abroad, young Muslim brothers can fall into haram and engage in impermissible activities. This could be due to their own desires, or due to peer pressure and influence from their friends.</p>
    <p>Tirmizi Trips is a tourism company where we take these young, Muslim brothers on vacation to foreign (mainly Muslim-Majority) countries. We want the brothers to have fun and enjoy themselves in a Halal, Fraternal environment â€“ free from any haram elements that may be present while abroad.</p>
    <h2>Why Join OUR trips? ðŸ¤”</h2>
    <p>So why join us on our trips, and not just travel by yourselves or with your friends?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We organise everything â€“ the activities, the hotels/accommodations and the transportation between cities â€“ whether that be flights or coach/minibuses. YOU just have to turn up.</li>
        <li>We plan out exactly where and what weâ€™ll be doing. One thing Iâ€™ve struggled with is finding out whatâ€™s interesting and worth doing, and what isnâ€™t. If youâ€™ve paid a decent amount of money to get to your holiday location, the last thing you want to do is waste hours or days figuring out where to go, how to get there and often realising something wasnâ€™t worth doing or seeing.</li>
        <li>Despite the planned nature of the trips, we also have free time included on our trips for you to do whatever you want. We donâ€™t want to hold your hand, control everything you do and make you feel like there was something you wanted to do but couldnâ€™t.</li>
        <li>Youâ€™ll be accompanied by a good batch of brothers. One issue I and many other brothers have is that they want to travel but donâ€™t have anyone to travel with or their friends are unserious. Our trips are a way of gathering these brothers together and a way for brothers to make good friends for life.</li>
        <li>Our trips are typically a combination of different elements. We want brothers to experience the culture and history of the country/cities they are visiting, have fun via activities like jet skiing, scuba diving or hiking but also relax and rest from whatever they are doing in their normal lives. We also aim to take the brothers to different parts of a country so they can experience the best that country has to offer.</li>
    </ol>
